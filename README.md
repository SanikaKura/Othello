# OTHELLO C++ with SFML
This project is a full implementation of the board game Othello/Reversi, using C++ and the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for graphics. It includes both single-player mode with a computer opponent, as well as two-player mode. The AI used in single player mode analyzes the effectiveness of possible moves, and uses known strategies such as keeping moves in the center of the board and expanding out slowly as opportunities arise. This creates a challenging and engaging experience for the user.

The program first launches this SFML page, prompting the user to select single or two player mode:

Once a mode is selected, the user is taken to the board with the starting position. Below, the user is playing black pieces against the computer palying whtites:

Once the board is filled, or there are no possible moves left, the bottom right of the screen shows either the black or white icon next to a trophy for the winner!
